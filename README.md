## Technology 

This application was created using JavaScript and [React](https://reactjs.org/) using [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/). 

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and the [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) were used for testing.

Data was taken from an external API with HTTP requests using [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios). Typechecking was done with [Prop Types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types).

### To do

* Add better styling CSS to make the application more visually appealing
* Add a gallery to allow full sized images to be viewed
* Improve media queries for different devices
* Add an event handler to remote 'No Results' message prior to search being started
